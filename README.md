# Burger Discord Bot

Burger is a multifunctional Discord bot built using Java and powered by the Discord JDA. The bot specializes in providing music playback, casino games, lo-fi channels, and other utility commands for enhancing your Discord experience.

## üìù Note
Sadly, the bot encountered limitations and can no longer join additional servers beyond 100. It currently resides in 97 servers. Instead of letting my efforts go in vain, I've decided to share the building process in hopes of helping and inspiring others in the community.
